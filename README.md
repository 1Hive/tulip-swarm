## ðŸŒ· Tulip

This is a loose issue tracker for the Tulip Swarm. There are various tasks and ideas tracked here, **but just because an issue exists for an idea, doesn't mean it will happen**.

Tulip is working on trading and DeFi infrastructure, including Honeyswap, a fork of Uniswap v2. It also maintains Honeycomb, the liquidity incentivization program for Honeyswap.

For Honeyswap, Tulip has enabled the protocol fee, and these fees are sent directly to the Common Pool, which means that adoption of Honeyswap will directly benefit 1hive.
